# CONTRIBUTING

All contributions must go through a Pull Request review before being accepted.

- Before opening a Pull Request, please consider the following questions:
  - Is the change ready enough to ask the community to spend time reviewing?
  - Is the change being proposed clearly explained and motivated?
- Keep PRs to a reasonable number of meaningful commits; avoid many minor or typo-only commits by squashing them.
- Use squash intentionally—preserve layered commits if they clarify the logic and aid code review.
- Please follow [the Apache Software Foundation Code of Conduct](https://www.apache.org/foundation/policies/conduct.html).

When you contribute code, you affirm that the contribution is your original work and that you
license the work to the project under the project's open source license. Whether or not you
state this explicitly, by submitting any copyrighted material via pull request, email, or
other means you agree to license the material under the project's open source license and
warrant that you have the legal authority to do so.
